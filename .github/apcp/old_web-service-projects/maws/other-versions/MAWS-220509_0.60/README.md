# About
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The **M**y**A**vatool **W**eb **S**ervice (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

# Features
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

# Requirements
* A location to host the Avatool Web Service which meets the following requirements:
  * .NET Framework 4.8+ installed
  * Access to your myAvatar™ environments from the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS

# Getting started
The [MAWS Manual](doc/man/manual.md) contains everything you need to know about MAWS, and is updated with each release.

# Development
MAWS is developed by [A Pretty Cool Program](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram) and these [contributors](src/Resources/Doc/contributors.md), using these [third-party resources](src/Resources/Doc/built-with.md).

To contribute to the development branch of MAWS, please see our [contributing guidelines](src/Resources/Doc/contributing.md).
