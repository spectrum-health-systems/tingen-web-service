# MAWS: The MyAvatar Web Service

Netsmart's [myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care. While a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), myAvatar™ isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The myAvatool Web Service (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## Features

* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## Requirements

A location to host the Avatool Web Service which meets the following requirements:

* .NET Framework 4.6.1+ installed
* Access to your myAvatar™ environments from the Avatool Web Service via HTTPS

## Manual

This README is pretty bare-bones because the [MAWS Manual](doc/man/manual.md) contains everything you need to know about MAWS, and is updated with each release. So go read that.

## Development

MAWS is developed by [A Pretty Cool Program](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram). For more information about MAWS development, and how to contribute, please see the [MAWS Development documentation](doc/development.md).
