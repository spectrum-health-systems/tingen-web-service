## About the MAWS sourcecode

### Sourcecode comments

MAWS is heavily commented.

I've tried to make this sourcecode as human-readable as possible, but since other organizations may use MAWS I've decided to heavily comment everything as well. I know this goes against best practice, however since Netsmart doesn't do the best job of making everything *they* do transparent, I want to make it sure that *my* code is as clear as possible as to what it does, and how it does it.

Each of the three different types of comments in MAWS start differently.

* `///` XML comments used by Visual Studio
* `//` Short comments intended to give additional information about a block of code.
* `/*...*/` Narrative comments when sourcecode concepts need to be explained in more detail.

Please do not remove any of the sourcecode comments, and if you fork MAWS for your own development, please and add your own.
