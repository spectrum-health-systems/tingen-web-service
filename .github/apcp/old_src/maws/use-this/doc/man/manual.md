# THE MYAVATOOL WEB SERVICE (MAWS)
[Netsmart's myAvatar™](https://www.ntst.com/Solutions-and-Services/Offerings/myAvatar) is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.

While myAvatar™ is a robust platform, like most things in life (except [Heroes of Might and Magic III](https://www.gog.com/game/heroes_of_might_and_magic_3_complete_edition)), it isn't perfect.

The good news is that myAvatar™ functionality can be extended via Netsmart's myAvatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by myAvatar™ users.

The **m**y**A**vatool **W**eb **S**ervice (**MAWS**) is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for myAvatar™ that aren't included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.

## MAWS FEATURES
* Several built-in tools and utilities for use with myAvatar™
* Does not require Java to be installed
* A solid foundation to build additional myAvatar™ custom tools and utilities

## MAWS REQUIREMENTS
* A location to host the MAWS which meets the following requirements:
* [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) 4.6.1+ installed
* Access to your myAvatar™ environments

## THE MANUAL
The [MAWS Manual](manual.md) (which you are reading *right now*) is updated with each release, and will walk you through setting up and using MAWS in your environments.

# GETTING STARTED 
To use MAWS, you will need to:
1. Verify you meet the [requirements](#requirements)
2. Find a location to [host](manual-hosting-maws.md) the MAWS sourcecode at your organization
3. [Import](manual-importing-maws.md) MAWS into your myAvatar™ environment
4. Setup [ScriptLink events](manual-scriptlink-events.md) in myAvatar™ forms

## FIRST STEP: HOSTING MAWS
The first step to using MAWS in your myAvatar™ environment is hosting the MAWS sourcecode at your organization, which is detailed [here](manual-hosting-maws.md).
