                The Tingen Web Service<br/>
                ----------------------<br/>
                Netsmart's Avatar™ is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that<br/>
                leverage real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.<br/>
                <br/>
                While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™<br/>
                functionality via Netsmart's Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other<br/>
                Avatar™ users.<br/>
                <br/>
                Tingen is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't<br/>
                included in the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality<br/>
                quickly and efficiently.
