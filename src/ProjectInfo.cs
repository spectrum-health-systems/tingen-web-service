        // About the Tingen Web Service
        // ----------------------------
        // Netsmart's Avatar™ is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage real-time analytics
        // and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.
        //
        // While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality via Netsmart's
        // Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other Avatar™ users.
        //
        // Tingen is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't included in the official
        // release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.
