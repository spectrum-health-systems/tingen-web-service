/* ----------------------
 * The Tingen Web Service
 * ----------------------
 * Netsmart's Avatar™ is a behavioral health EHR that offers a recovery-focused suite of solutions that leverage
 * real-time analytics and clinical decision support to drive value-based care.
 *
 * While Avatar™ is a robust platform, it isn't perfect. The good news is that you can extend myAvatar™ functionality
 * via Netsmart's Avatar™ Web Services, and/or custom web services that are written by other Avatar™ users.
 *
 * Tingen is one such custom web service which includes various tools and utilities for Avatar™ that aren't included in
 * the official release, and provides a solid foundation for building additional functionality quickly and efficiently.
